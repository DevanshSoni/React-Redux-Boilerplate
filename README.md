## React Redux Boilerplate

This repository contains structured project template for React JS with most commonly used packages used for general purpose operations like lodash, moment etc.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker build .`

Starts building Docker Image from Dockerfile present in current repository.

### `docker-compose up`

Start composing/creating Docker Container named (container_web_1 Can be changed from docker-compose file) from image created in the last step.

```
Note 
1. There should be docker service up and running in your environment in order to use this boilerplate.
